# Belly-Button-Biodiversity-Analysis

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to present interactive visualizations of belly button biodiversity data within a web page. Since the baseline data was provided in JSON format, D3 was used to import and process the data, while Plotly was used to generate the required visualizations.

## Questions

1. What is the demographic information of the individual associated with a specific belly button sample?
2. What are the top ten Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) by concentration in a specific belly button sample?
3. What are the concentrations of all the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in a specific belly button sample?
4. What is the weekly wash frequency of a specific belly button sample?
